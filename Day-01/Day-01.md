Below is the description of the Adobe App Builder training series presented by Ranjeet Barsa.

Overview

Hello — I'm Ranjeet Barsa. In this series we'll explore Adobe App Builder and how it modernizes integrations with Adobe Commerce.

Why App Builder

- App Builder enables building standalone apps that extend Adobe Commerce using APIs and microservices.
- This approach reduces coupling, improves scalability, and simplifies maintenance compared to monolithic extensions.

Context: Adobe Commerce evolution

- Magento 1 started as a monolithic platform with tightly integrated frontend, backend, and data layers.
- Magento 2 improved architecture and introduced cloud hosting options.
- After Adobe acquired Magento, the platform moved toward headless patterns with better REST and GraphQL APIs.

Modern composable services

- Adobe now provides composable services such as Live Search, Catalog Service, Product Recommendations, Price Indexer, and Payments — each can scale independently.

What is Adobe App Builder?

- A platform and framework for building, deploying, and managing custom apps on Adobe's cloud.
- Key components: Adobe Developer Console, `aio` CLI, Spectrum React components, Adobe I/O Runtime (serverless), Adobe I/O Events, and webhooks.
- API Mesh: combine multiple data sources into a single GraphQL surface for simpler integration.

Use cases

- Build integrations with PIM/ERP systems using the Integration Starter Kit.
- Implement real-time event handling (order notifications, inventory updates, shipping calculations).
- Embed SPAs in the Adobe Commerce admin UI using React Spectrum components.

Developer mindset

- Move from monolithic thinking to microservices: design small, focused services that communicate via APIs.
- Benefits: faster deployments, targeted scaling, easier maintenance, and incremental modernization of existing projects.

Course plan

- We'll cover App Builder fundamentals and then progress through setup, development, deployment, and integration patterns — presented day-wise.
